# Thinking in C++ :: Volume 1 :: Formatted for Kindle

The book by Bruce Eckel. I took the HTML and wrote a script to
reformat it for my 6-inch Kindle. Work is still in progress, but
results are good.

This is Volume 1. I'm reading it and I'll format Volume 2 when I'll
get to it.

## License

I'm probably not allowed to do this. I'm not seeing a license to this
book (only for the code contained), which means the work itself is an
"All Rights Reserved". Redistribution of a reformatted version is
probably not allowed, but I sent an email to Mr. Bruce Eckel asking
him for permission (if he replies NO, I'll delete the project).

You can use the builder if you want for whatever purposes.
