# Thinking in C++ :: Volume 1 :: Formatted for Kindle

The book by Bruce Eckel. I took the HTML and wrote a script to
reformat it for my 6-inch Kindle. Work is still in progress, but
results are good.

This is Volume 1. I'm reading it and I'll format Volume 2 when I'll
get to it.

## License

I'm probably not allowed to do this. I'm not seeing a license to this
book (only for the code contained), which means the work itself is an
"All Rights Reserved". But whatever, if anybody has a problem with it
I'll just delete the generated file.

You can use the builder if you want for whatever purposes.
